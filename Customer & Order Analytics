# In this SQL , I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders where placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND orderid <> ''
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT order_id
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON Bit_DB.customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
AND order_id <> ''
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE order_id <> '' 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity) * price AS revenue, product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM (Quantity) * price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
count (distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND order_id <> ''
AND order_id <> ' Order ID'
